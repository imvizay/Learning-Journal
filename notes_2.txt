// Drf does not support various fields that is supported by django models such as :-

   -- serializers.IntegerField -- 
   for every number releted field serializer consider them inside integer field

   -- serializer.CharField --
   for every string releted or text reletef field drf consider them inside Charfield

   -- Relation field -- 

   - PrimaryKeyRelatedField(many=True) - many to many field
   - PrimaryKeyRelatedField - one to many field/ one to one field 



// validated_data vs data 

    think of serializer as two faces of a coin 
    Once face talks to the database
    other talks to the outside world(api response)

    VALIDATED_DATA = used only for create and update logic
    1.Pure python data.
    2.Already passes all validation.
    3.Used only for create/update logic.
    (self.create(self,validated_data))
    (self.update(self,instance,validated_data))

    4.never return in API response automatically.


    Data = used for representation
    1.used in Response(serializer.data)
    2.does not requrie validation
