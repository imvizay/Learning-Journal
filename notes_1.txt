// from rest_framework.serializer import Serializer

    when we user Serializer class then in the serializers.py we have to manully defined the serializer fields for the model and even the crud actions (create,put,patch,delete) and cannot the other way we did while using the 

// from rest_framework.serializer import ModelSerializer

    we doont have to do anything manually doing it manually is totally optional untill we want to override the function
    using class meta provide relief for heavy line of code doing

// defination of constraints manually 

    age = serializers.IntegerField(min_value=0, max_value=120)

    " 
    1.If we are using Serializer instead of ModelSerializer,we have to define the constraints manually as there is no meta class model to infer constraints from so we have to do it manually 
    
    2.And also if we dont defined the constraints manually then assuming this Model.objects.create(validated_data)
    will do it afterwards before saving instance into the database is wrong as sometimes this may gets messay and it would raise error at db level and frontend wont receive proper clear error response 
    "


// serializer.is_valid()
    is_valid () , does all validation regarding the 

    constraints defined = blank = false,unique=True,max_length
    field defined = name = models.CharField 
                           age = models.IntegerField.  

    field level validation  = fieldname_validate(self,value)
    object level validation  = validate(self,data)


// save() 

    this decided whether to call the create method or update method of the serializer as inter it checks for the paramter value of the instance when we call serializer in the view 

   **** serializer = Serializer(instance=obj,data=request.data) *****


// is_valid is gatekeeper between the request and the database 
    
    serializer.is_valid() validates incoming request data against serializer rules, runs field-level and object-level validations, converts data into Python-safe types, and ensures only clean data proceeds to saving.

// raise_exception=True

    without it :- 
    /------------------------
    if serializer.is_valid():
        serializer.save()
    else:
        return Response(serializer.errors, status=400)
    \---------------------------

    this helps us saves writting more boilterplate instead of doing if else for is_valid we pass 
    is_valid(raise_exception=True)

    if is_valid() gets fails drf automatically runs the else condition and generate error response automatically
