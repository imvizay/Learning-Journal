// NESTED SERIALIZERS

class ProductSerializer(serializer.ModelSerializer):
    author = serializer.PrimaryKeyReletedField(queryset=Author.objects.all())

    class Meta:
        model = Product
        fields = "__all__"


-- author = serializer.PrimaryKeyReletedField(queryset=Author.objects.all())

    this declaration is done here to make the serializer class validates the input sent by postman or frontend for the author field as the frontend probably will sent a user id(integer)
    to check that a valid user exists with that id in the data or not thats why we passed a query set as parameter to that PrimaryKeyReletedField

    "queryset" is exactlly telling the drf to lookup the field in that model for the provided value 
    to ensure that a user exists or not without it the drf will throw an error
